# Keystone Engine (Patching)

This project is currently self-shipping a [fork](https://github.com/gaasedelen/keystone) of the ubiquitous [Keystone Engine](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone) rather than using the PyPI version.

This is simply out of convenience for distributing fixes or making breaking changes for the betterment of the project.

# Why is this folder empty?

The directory that you're reading this in will be populated by a GitHub [Workflow](https://github.com/gaasedelen/titan/blob/main/.github/workflows/package-project.yaml) that packages the project for distribution.

You should always download the final, distributable version of the project from the [releases](https://github.com/gaasedelen/titan/releases) page of this repo. If you cloned the repo and tried to run this project, that's probably why it's not working and you're here reading this ;-)
